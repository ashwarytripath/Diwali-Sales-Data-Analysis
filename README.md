# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This README file provides an overview of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process performed on the Diwali Sales dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about sales during the Diwali festival. The analysis aims to gain insights into various aspects of the data, such as gender-wise sales, age groups, top-selling products, popular states, and more.
**Dataset**
User_ID: The unique identifier for each user/customer.
Cust_name: The name of the customer.
Product_ID: The unique identifier for each product.
Gender: The gender of the customer (male or female).
Age Group: The age group of the customer (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.).
Age: The age of the customer.
Marital_Status: The marital status of the customer (married or unmarried).
State: The state from where the order was placed.
Zone: The zone of the state where the order was placed.
Occupation: The occupation of the customer (e.g., IT, Healthcare, etc.).
Product_Category: The category of the product sold (e.g., Food, Clothing, Electronics, etc.).
Orders: The number of orders for each product.
Amount: The total sales amount for each transaction.
**Tools Used**
The analysis was performed using the following Python libraries:

**pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
**numpy**: For numerical computations.
**matplotlib:** For data visualization.
**seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
**Steps for EDA**
**Data Loading:** The first step involves loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

**Data Cleaning:** Check for any missing or duplicate data and handle them appropriately. Perform data type conversions if necessary.

**Data Visualization**: Create various plots and charts to visually explore different aspects of the data, such as gender distribution, age groups, top-selling products, popular states, and more.

**Insights and Conclusions**: Summarize the findings and draw meaningful insights from the EDA process.
